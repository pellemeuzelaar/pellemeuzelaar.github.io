          <p class="intro">These are some of my projects. The first two are related to data-analysis and optimisation and were written in Python. The assignments were carried out during the Technology and Operations Management (TOM) master's program. The others are projects that mainly demonstrate my front-end development capabilities.</h3>

              <p class="description">For my master's thesis, I designed a supply chain for CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization & Storage) across six European countries. The supply chain activities include capturing CO₂ emissions from industry and utilizing it for the production of urea, e-methanol and Sustainable Aviation Fuel whilst storing the remainder underground. Using a mathematical model in Python, I optimized the supply chain to minimize costs. Scenario analysis based on qualitative research introduced practical constraints. The project demonstrated how cross-border collaboration can create a more cost-effective supply chain which significantly reduces industrial CO₂ emissions. The project was awarded a 7 out of 10.</p>

              <p class="description">During the course Data Analysis and Programming, I was tasked with allocating tablets and smartphones to a new warehouse for Belsimpel. This expansion allowed Belsimpel to increase product sales over the long term, although it inevitably led to longer shipping times. Using Python querying, I minimized profit losses resulting from these increased delivery times. The assignment was graded a 7.2 out of 10.</p>

              <p class="description">This project provides a way for musicians to connect and form a band. The user can submit their preferences and the answers will be listed publically. This allows others looking for a specific player's attributes to connect with them and form a band or musical group. Eventually this project may be developed into a platform for multiple users. It currently only supports the data submission of a single user. This project was made out of a personal interest as I am a guitarist myself and I would like to connect with other musicians.</p>

              <p class="description">This short webpage provides information on my favourite guitarist, Mark Knopfler of the Dire Straits. I am a fan of his guitar playing and aim to replicate it accurately. The project was made to broaden my knowledge about his playing style. Furthermore, I wanted to develop my ability to style websites using HTHML and CSS. The end-result: a lovely tribute to Mark.</p>

              <p class="description">Continuing on the theme of guitar music: this is a website that outlines the technical details of a Fender Stratocaster. It serves as a user manual of sorts. The Stratocaster is my personal favorite model, and I own one myself. To better understand the instrument, I created a webpage that summarizes its technical specifications in one place. This project also served as an opportunity to practice structuring and styling webpages using HTML and CSS.</p>

              <p class="description">This project presents a mock-up of an alternative webshop for the guitar brand Fender. While I do not intend to sell guitars myself, I wanted to practice creating a webshop layout. I chose guitars as the theme because of my personal interest in the subject. The project further expanded my knowledge of HTML and CSS.</p>

            <div class="about-text">
              <p class="subscript">I am a solution-oriented starter with a background in data analysis and process optimization. After being trained in handling complex datasets and extracting insights, I soon developed an interest in how those insights are presented to users—visually and interactively. This led me to explore front-end development, combining my technical foundation with creativity. Driven by this shift, I completed a software development bootcamp (FreeCodeCamp.org) and built this project portfolio.</p>
              <p class="subscript">I am driven by societal challenges, especially the energy transition. This has been a key topic in my academic background and professional experience (see my CV). In addition, I aim to contribute to national security by becoming a reservist in the Dutch army. I am looking for a developer role (full-stack or front-end) that enables me to align my newly gained development skills with my commitment to societal issues. I am proficient in Python (data analysis), Java, HTML, and CSS (software development), and currently preparing for the Scrum PSM I certification.</p>
